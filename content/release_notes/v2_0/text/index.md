The old term "String" has been renamed to "Text" in many places.

## Repeat Text

Fill Text node was renamed repeat text for convention.

{{< video repeat_text.mp4 >}}

## Replicate Text

Replicate Text node was removed because the same function can be done
using the repeat text node by leaving the text input empty. See example
above.

## Reverse Text

Reverse Text node was added that reverse the input text's character's
order.

## Text Object Output

Implemented Horizontal and Vertical Alignment. Also it has been
vectorized.
