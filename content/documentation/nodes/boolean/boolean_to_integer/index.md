## Demonstration

The true form of booleans is a binary where 1 means `True` and 0 means
`False`. The logical gates itself is just a simple arithmetical
operation on those binaries. e.g. an *And* gate is just a multiplication
and *Or* gate is just an addition clamped to 1. This node is just a
converter that convert booleans into binaries.

## Inputs

- **Boolean** - An input boolean.

## Outputs

- **Number** - The binary.

## Advanced Node Settings

- N/A
