Creating a new Node
*******************

A node is a single python file. All registration is done automatically.

**Where to put the node?**

    - Choose one of the existing node categories (folders inside the ``nodes`` directory) or
    - Create a new category. To do that make a new folder and put an empty file called ``__init__.py`` inside.
