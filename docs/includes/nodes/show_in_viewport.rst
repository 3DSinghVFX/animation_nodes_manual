Advanced Node Settings
----------------------

- **Show in viewport** - If this option is enabled, the property will show up in the *Data Input* panel in the *AN* tab in the *Tool Shelf*. The name of that property is defined by the node label if it is set. This option is useful if one want to edit some parameters in the node tree directly from within the 3d viewport without having to go the node editor.
