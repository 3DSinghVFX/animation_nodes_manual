Object info
===========

The object info node outputs:

- **location:** a vector that contains the position of the object
- **rotation:** a vector that contains the rotation of the object
- **scale:** a vector that contains the scale of the object
- **location velocity:** a vector that contains the translational velocity of the object
- **rotation velocity:** a vector that contains the rotational velocity of the object
- **scale velocity:** a vector that contains the scaling velocity of the object

This node takes an object as input of course... And a frame number, because all those vectors can change from frame to frame.
