Object List
===========

The object list node creates a list of objects.
When you insert it in the node tree, you have 2 options to add objects to the list.

- **New Item:** let's you add objects manually to the list by presenting you an objec picker
- **From selection:** adds all the selected objects into the list, and it seems like the objects are added in the order of the selection.

The output is of course a list of objects and not just a single object.
