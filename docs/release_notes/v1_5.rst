Release Notes for Version 1.5
=============================


Custom Frequency Ranges
***********************

It is possible to bake a custom amount of frequency ranges in the *Sound Bake* node.
Previously there were 10 hardcoded ranges.

Conditional Debug Nodes
***********************

The *Debug* and *Debug Drawer* node have a *Conditional* input now (which is hidden
by default). This allows more precise and easier debugging in loops and other
cases where a node is executed multiple times with different inputs.

Basic Shape Key Implementation
******************************

The two new socket types *Shape Key* and *Shape Key List* are part of AN now.
Also the *Object Instancer* node handles objects with shape keys much better in v1.5.

Get Selected Objects Node
*************************

This node can easily be used together with the new conditional debug nodes.
It's important to know that this node will only work while during creation of
the node tree. When you start the render it is disabled, because your render
should not depend on the selection.


Math Operations
***************

New *Snap* operation that can be used in the *Float, Vector and Euler Math* node.
This enables you to snap values to specific increments.

New *Vector Angle* node that can calculate the angle between two vectors as well
as the rotation difference.


Parse Number Node
*****************

This node can convert a text into a number which is handy when you want to parse
a text block or something similiar that contains numbers.
