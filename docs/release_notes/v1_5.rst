Custom Frequency Ranges
***********************

It is possible to bake a custom amount of frequency ranges in the *Sound Bake* node.
Previously there were 10 hardcoded ranges.

Conditional Debug Nodes
***********************

The *Debug* and *Debug Drawer* node have a *Conditional* input now (which is hidden
by default). This allows more precise and easier debugging in loops and other
cases where a node is executed multiple times with different inputs.

The two new socket types *Shape Key* and *Shape Key List* are part of AN now.
