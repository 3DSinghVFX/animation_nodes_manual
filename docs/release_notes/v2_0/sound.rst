Sounds
******

Sound nodes have been redesigned visually and had some inputs renamed but functionally it is still the same.

The *Single* and *Equalizer* sound types are called *Average* and *Spectrum* now. These names are used more often in other software as well.

Also the output of the *Evaluate Sound* node is called *Volume/Volumes* now depending on which sound type is selected.
