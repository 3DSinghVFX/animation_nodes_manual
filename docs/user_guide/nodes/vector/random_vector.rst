Random Vector
==================

**Additional Seed:** If two nodes have the same value here, they will generate the same random vectors (when the seed is the same). This is like adding another random value to the *Seed* input.

**Seed:** Two *Random Vector* nodes with the same seed will generate the vectors.

**Max Value:** This defines how large the new vector is.
