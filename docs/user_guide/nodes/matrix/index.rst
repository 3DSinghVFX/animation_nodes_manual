Matrices are a way of representing locations, rotations and scales of objects, they can also represents translations, rotations and scaling transformations.

When matrix A is multiplied by matrix B, then matrix A will be transformed based on matrix B, if matrix B was a translation matrix, then matrix A will be translated.
