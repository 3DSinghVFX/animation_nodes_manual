On this page I want to give a quick overview where you to find everything
that has to do with this addon in Blender. Obviously most settings are
located in the node editor but not all of them.


The node menu
=============

The menu to insert new nodes opens when pressing ``shift-A`` like in the
compositing and material nodes. The menu is fairly large with many submenus.
It is not ideal for a quick workflow but it helps when you forgot the name
of a node.

The node search
===============

The search box (``ctrl-A``) enables you to quickly find and insert nodes by
their name. Some nodes have multiple search tags to make it easier to find them.
Also here are all installed nodes. Not only a subset like in the menu.
