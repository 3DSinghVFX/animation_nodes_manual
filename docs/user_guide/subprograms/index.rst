Subprograms
===========

If you think about it you notice that all node setups you built are nothing else
than programs in a visual form. And like in normal programming the addon allows
you to create reusable subprograms. A subprogram must not be connected with
nodes outside. Currently there are 3 different types of subprograms. Groups,
Loops and Scripts. They all can be called using the *Invoke Subprogram* node.
