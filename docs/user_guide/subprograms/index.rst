Subprograms
===========

A subprogram is a group of nodes encapsulated to form a function that takes some inputs and return some outputs or perform a certain task. Subprograms are modular in the sense that they are reusable, once a subprogram is defined, it can be called/invoked using the *Invoke node* as much as needed with possibly different inputs. By using subprograms, one avoid to repeat similar parts of the node tree resulting in a more efficient and organized node tree. A subprogram can be defined in three different ways using:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   Group <group>
   Loop <loop>
   Script <script>

Which can be called/invoked using:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   Invoke Node <invoke>

A minimal version of the script subprogram is provided using:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   Expression Node <expression>
